##### Project Description
Project Shadow is a 2D top down game mixed with horror survival elements. The player will be thrown into a dark dungeon, in which they must run, hide, solve puzzles, and use their light source efficiently to help escape the enemy monster chasing after them.

The player can play as one character. They will then be placed in the same dungeon stage with increasing difficulty as they progress through the game. Each arena will consist of several puzzles, each of which consists of a certain number of keys needed to be collected. The lightsource the player possesses will slowly run out, thus, the player needs to collect fuel around the stages. Once the fuel runs out or the enemy monster catches up, it’s game over.

#### Story and Gameplay
##### Story( Detailed)
The protagonist of Project Shadow is searching for their father who went missing after an accident ten years ago. The protagonist has been searching desperately for their father and has only managed to find one clue. One day, however, the protagonist is kidnapped and knocked unconscious. When they awaken, they find themselves in a dungeon with only a light source. They notice claw marks on the wall and theorize that they are not alone. The protagonist must use their wits and light source in order to escape and survive.

##### Gameplay( Detailed)
Project Shadow is a strategic game with horror survival elements. The player has to survive stages inside a dungeon, while escaping the monster who is trying to devour the player. In the beginning the player is dropped into a dungeon with only a light source. Within each stage, the player must gather resources and maintain the amount of fuel source. This is all while running and hiding from the monster. As the player progresses through rounds and racks up a higher score, the enemy monster’s speed with increase, increasing the stage difficulty. There is no end to the rounds, they simply get more difficult until the player fails.

In order to escape the enemy monster, the player will have to run or hide from the chasing monster. The player will have to use these skills to overcome obstacles in the way. The player then has to complete puzzles that come their way, which incorporates strategic thinking. After the puzzles are solved, keys are dropped, which allows the player to progress to the next stage.

The player must also maintain their existing light source from the lamp/torch. This is more or less the player’s life source because without being able to see, the enemy monster ends up killing the player. The player is allowed to gather fuel in order to increase the amount of light source, however, there is a limited amount of fuel within each level.

After the completion of each stage, the difficulty starts to increase and makes it harder to escape the enemy monster. The puzzles will increase in difficulty. In addition, the further the player progresses in the game, the speed of the monster increases and gives the player a limited amount of time before the game is over.
